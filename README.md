# Reto_9
I updated the `Shape` package by adding `@property` decorators to provide controlled access to protected attributes, replacing explicit getter and setter methods. I also implemented a `@classmethod` in `Shape` to allow dynamic modification of `shape_type`. Additionally, I introduced a custom `timing_decorator` to measure and display the execution time of `compute_area()`, enhancing performance tracking. The `main.py` file was updated accordingly to reflect these changes, ensuring seamless integration of the new features.
